# GRB 230307A: INTEGRAL upper limit on Hard X-ray emission afterglow

<!-- TODO: SPI sat and nonsat rates, SPI-ACS, afterglow -->

Following the detection of the very luminous GRB~230307A by Fermi/GBM and others (GCN #33405, GCN #33406, GCN #33407, GCN #33410, GCN #33411, GCN #33412, GCN #33413, GCN #33414, GCN #33415, GCN #33416, GCN #33418, GCN #33419, GCN #33424, GCN #33425, GCN #33427, GCN #33428, GCN #33429, GCN #33430, GCN #33431, GCN #33434, GCN #33437, GCN #33438, GCN #33439, GCN #33442, GCN #33443), we have performed INTEGRAL pointed observations of the GRB~230307A location.

INTEGRAL observation was scheduled at the time when the best available localization was provided by the combination of the Fermi/GBM localization and early IPN localization. Location of the higher-precision IPN localization was within partially coded are of the observation.

INTEGRAL pointed observation lasted from 2023-03-08T11:35:00 (T0 + 19.8 hours, where T0 is 2023-03-07T15:44:07) to 2023-03-09T02:18:20 (T0 + 34.6 hours) with a total exposure time of 28.2 ks (for ISGRI).


The upper limit is factor XX lower than in the case of GRB221009A (and factor XX lower in ratio to prompt emission luminosity). appears rather similar to GRB120711A, but at 10 times smaller distance.

We are grateful to the INTEGRAL Groud Segment team for ever more quickly scheduling the observations.
