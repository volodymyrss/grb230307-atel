# GRB 230307A: INTEGRAL upper limit on Hard X-ray afterglow

At the time of the very bright GRB 230307A ([GCN #33405](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33405.gcn3), [GCN #33406](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33406.gcn3), [GCN #33407](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33407.gcn3), [GCN #33410](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33410.gcn3), [GCN #33411](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33411.gcn3), [GCN #33412](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33412.gcn3), [GCN #33413](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33413.gcn3), [GCN #33414](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33414.gcn3), [GCN #33415](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33415.gcn3), [GCN #33416](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33416.gcn3), [GCN #33418](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33418.gcn3), [GCN #33419](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33419.gcn3), [GCN #33424](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33424.gcn3), [GCN #33425](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33425.gcn3), [GCN #33427](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33427.gcn3), [GCN #33428](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33428.gcn3), [GCN #33429](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33429.gcn3), [GCN #33430](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33430.gcn3), [GCN #33431](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33431.gcn3), [GCN #33434](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33434.gcn3), [GCN #33437](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33437.gcn3), [GCN #33438](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33438.gcn3), [GCN #33439](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33439.gcn3), [GCN #33442](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33442.gcn3), [GCN #33443](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33443.gcn3), [GCN #33444](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33444.gcn3), [GCN #33447](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33447.gcn3), [GCN #33448](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33448.gcn3), [GCN #33449](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33449.gcn3), [GCN #33453](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33453.gcn3), [GCN #33459](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33459.gcn3), [GCN #33461](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33461.gcn3), [GCN #33465](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33465.gcn3), [GCN #33466](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33466.gcn3)), INTEGRAL was pointing 74 deg from the GRB direction. Such an exceptionally high flux lead to a detection in various ratemeters of INTEGRAL often causing saturation. From moderately saturated SPI-ACS observation, we can estimate a likely close lower limit on the total flux in 75 - 2000 keV energy range at the level of 0.0015 erg cm-2 s-1 in the time range T0+-0.0s to T0+130.0s where T0 = 2023-03-07T15:44:07.

We note that despite the GRB brightness, both SPI-ACS and PICsIT observations do not reveal early afterglow and no emission past T0+130.0~s, with an approximate upper limit on average 75-2000 keV flux between T0+129s and of T0+259 s at the level of 5.8e-09 erg cm-2 s-1. Instead, prompt emission decays exponentially following the Comparable with Swift GCN#33431


A ToO pointed observation was carried out from 2023-03-08 11:35:00 (T0 + 19.8 hours) to 2023-03-09 02:18:20 (T0 + 34.6 hours) with a total exposure time of 28.2 ks (for ISGRI). 
Since the observation was scheduled when the refined IPN localization was not yet available, the position of the candidate GRB optical and X-ray afterglow (([GCN #33429](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33429.gcn3), [GCN #33439](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33439.gcn3), [GCN #33443](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33443.gcn3), [GCN #33447](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33447.gcn3), [GCN #33449](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33449.gcn3), [GCN #33459](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33459.gcn3), [GCN #33465](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/33465.gcn3))) was observed at an offset of , reducing somewhat the effective exposure of JEM-X compared to an optimal pointing.


INTEGRAL follow-up observation was scheduled at the time when the best available localization was provided by the combination of the Fermi/GBM and early IPN localizations, including SPI-ACS. Center of the observation was 1.3 deg from the true location of the afterglow  somewhat reducing effective exposure of JEM-X comparing to an optimal pointing. The pointed observation lasted from 2023-03-08 11:35:00 (T0 + 19.8 hours, where T0 is 2023-03-07 15:44:07) to 2023-03-09 02:18:20 (T0 + 34.6 hours) with a total exposure time of 28.2 ks (for ISGRI).

We do not find any significant signal, and put a limit on any source within the IPN error box, including also to the possible X-ray and optical afterglow, at the level of 4.2e-11 erg cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in the 3-200 keV energy range, assuming a powerlaw spectrum with a slope of -2. This limit is about 1.2 orders of magnitude lower than the detection in the case of GRB 221009A. 

We are grateful to the INTEGRAL Ground Segment team for the quick scheduling of these observations.

<!-- . As is sometimes the case for exceptional GRBs, BGO-attenuated non-vetoed SPI GeD rate reveals clear signal, giving an idea of the true intensity of the burst, suggesting that SPI-ACS signal was not strongly attenuated, and provide an estimate of the fluence at the level of XX in 75-2000 keV -->
